This is a simple Food Menu made with React and Vite. 

Its displayed on a Big Monitor. It acceses the Website via the Projection with a raspberry PI3. 

The Raspberry PI3 is using a script that opens the Standard Browser when its turned on. Then it runs the NPM command to run the Website via Vite and shows it in Fullscreen on the Monitor.

The Food List was a bit long so i wrote an intervall function to let the pages change every few(5) seconds.
